## Options Trading Record Keeper

## Goals  

Application being developed for my father whom is an options trader as a *side hustle*. He currently keeps track of all trades in an excel spreadsheet, which is both tedious and highly automatable. This process can be automated in one of two ways: API calls to the brokerages he uses (SEC guidelines may make this difficult) or parsing the manually downloadable .csv or similar files that is likely supported by every respectable brokerage. The other problem that this application attempts to solve is the ability to provide my father with easy to understand and relevant metrics about his trading performance.  

This README will represent a living document in which I will continually update the project's goals as it develops.
